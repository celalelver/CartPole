# 🏆 Deep Q-Learning with CartPole  

This project trains an agent using the **Deep Q-Learning** algorithm in the `CartPole-v0` environment. Popular libraries like **TensorFlow/Keras**, **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Gym**, and **Matplotlib** are used.

## 🚀 How It Works  

The agent makes decisions based on observations from the environment and optimizes the learning process using **experience replay**.  

### 🔧 Techniques Used:  
- **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**  
- **Epsilon-Greedy Strategy**  
- **Experience Replay Memory**  
- **Adaptive Epsilon Decay**  

## 📦 Requirements  

Ensure the following libraries are installed before running the project:  

```bash
pip install numpy pandas tensorflow keras gym matplotlib
